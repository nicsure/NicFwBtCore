This is a very quickly thrown together MAUI project that demonstrates the basics of the bluetooth functions and reading/writing channels from/to the TD-H3 radio running nicFW.
It is my hope this demo project will be enough basis for others to put together a decent channel programmer for mobile devices.

This app "should" function as a bare bones programmer, but it's far from feature packed and likely not bug-free, it's not MVVM, it's all event driven, there's repeated code, no optimization, in short it's shit. I am not developing this further, the idea is to make something others can use as a base source or reference. So don't be haranging me to add features or fix bugs etc.. because I won't, do it yourself.
